The error you're encountering suggests that the script attempted to open an HDF5 file (`worker_file`) that was either missing or corrupted, which triggered an `OSError`. The error message "file signature not found" typically indicates that the file does not exist, is not an HDF5 file, or is corrupted.

To ensure this error is detected reliably and the process stops cleanly when an invalid worker file is encountered, you can modify the script to include error handling around the file opening operation. Here’s a potential approach to modify your script:

1. **Add Error Handling**: Use a `try-except` block around the code that opens the HDF5 file. This will allow you to catch the error and handle it gracefully.

2. **Log the Error**: When an error occurs, log the error message with sufficient detail so you can diagnose the issue later.

3. **Stop the Process**: If necessary, you can stop the entire process or skip the problematic file, depending on your requirements.

Here's a modified version of the relevant part of your script:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import sys

def main():
    # Set up logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Your existing code...
    
    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Your code for processing the file...
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to open file {worker_file}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program with an error code

    # Your remaining code...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:

- **Logging**: The script uses Python’s `logging` module to log errors. This is generally better than using `print` statements because it provides more flexibility in managing output, including setting different log levels and directing logs to files or other outputs.

- **Graceful Exit**: `sys.exit(1)` is used to stop the script execution when an error is encountered. You can choose a different exit code or implement a different logic based on your needs (e.g., continue with other files).

- **Error Message**: The error message includes the filename and the exception message to help in diagnosing issues.

### Recovery:

If you have other files that might contain the missing data, you can implement additional logic to attempt recovery or use a fallback mechanism when a file is found to be invalid.

### Additional Considerations:

- **File Validation**: Before attempting to open the file, you could implement a preliminary check to see if the file exists and is of the expected size or format, which might provide an early indication of issues.

- **Retry Logic**: If the error might be transient (e.g., due to file system issues), you could implement a retry mechanism to attempt opening the file multiple times before giving up.

By integrating these changes, you should be able to handle file-related errors more robustly, ensuring your script can either continue processing other files or exit cleanly when encountering critical issues.
