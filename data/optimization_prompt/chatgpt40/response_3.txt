The error message you are encountering indicates that there is an issue with opening an HDF5 file, specifically an `OSError` stating "Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)." This is likely due to an invalid or corrupted HDF5 file being accessed. Here's how you can modify the script to detect this error reliably and stop the process cleanly if any worker file is invalid:

1. **Add Error Handling**: Wrap the file access code in a try-except block to handle the `OSError` and any other potential exceptions that might occur when trying to open the file.

2. **Log and Exit Gracefully**: If an error is detected, log the error and exit the process gracefully, ensuring that resources are cleaned up properly.

3. **Consider Data Validation**: Before processing, you might want to validate the files to ensure they are not corrupted.

Here's a suggested modification to your script:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import sys

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    
    try:
        # Assuming `worker_files` is a list of file paths you want to process
        for worker_file in worker_files:
            try:
                with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                    # Your processing logic here
                    pass
            except OSError as e:
                logging.error(f"Failed to open file {worker_file}: {e}")
                # Exit the process if a file is invalid
                sys.exit(1)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Unexpected error with file {worker_file}: {e}")
                # Exit the process for unexpected errors
                sys.exit(1)

        logging.info("Completed processing all worker files.")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred in the main process: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Data Backup**: If feasible, keep backups of your HDF5 files so you can recover from them in case of corruption.
- **File Validation**: Consider implementing a validation step that checks the integrity of each HDF5 file before processing.
- **Logging**: Ensure that your logging is sufficiently detailed to track which files were processed successfully and which ones failed, along with the reasons for failure.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Depending on your application's requirements, you might implement a retry mechanism for transient errors.

By implementing these changes, you should be able to detect file-related errors early and stop your process cleanly when such errors occur.
