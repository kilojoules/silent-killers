The error you're encountering is due to an issue with opening an HDF5 file using the `h5py` library. The error message `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)` suggests that there is a problem with the file signature of the HDF5 file you are trying to open. This typically indicates that the file is either corrupted, incomplete, or not an HDF5 file at all.

To handle this error more gracefully and ensure the script stops cleanly when such an issue is detected, you can modify your script to include error handling when opening HDF5 files. Specifically, you can use a try-except block to catch the `OSError` and handle it appropriately. Below is an example of how you can modify your script:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import sys

def main():
    worker_file = 'your_worker_file_path_here.h5'
    
    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Your processing logic here
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open HDF5 file: {worker_file}. Error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit the script with a non-zero status to indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Continue with your script logic if no errors are encountered

if __name__ == '__main__':
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    main()
```

### Key Modifications:
1. **Error Handling**: Use a try-except block around the HDF5 file opening operation to catch `OSError` and handle it by logging an error message and exiting the script.
2. **Logging**: Use the `logging` module to log error messages. This is more flexible and professional than using print statements, especially for larger scripts or applications.
3. **Exit on Error**: Use `sys.exit(1)` to exit the script with a non-zero status, indicating that an error occurred.

### Additional Suggestions:
- **File Validation**: Before attempting to open the file, you might want to validate its existence and size, or check for known good file signatures if applicable.
- **Backup and Recovery**: If you have backup files or logs, consider implementing a recovery mechanism to attempt reprocessing of the failed operations.
- **Testing**: Test the modified script with a variety of scenarios, including valid and invalid files, to ensure that error handling works as expected.

By implementing these changes, your script will be more robust and better able to handle errors related to file handling, thus preventing it from failing silently or continuing in an undefined state.
