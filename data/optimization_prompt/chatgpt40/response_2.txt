The error you're encountering is related to an issue with opening a file using the `h5py` library. The specific error, `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)`, indicates that the program attempted to open an HDF5 file, but the file is either corrupted or not a valid HDF5 file.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Corrupted File**: The file could be incomplete or corrupted.
2. **Incorrect Path**: The path to the file may be incorrect.
3. **File Type Mismatch**: The file might not be an HDF5 file, even though it was expected to be.

### Steps to Diagnose:
1. **Verify File Path**: Ensure that the file path is correct and accessible.
2. **Check File Integrity**: Verify the integrity of the file. You can do this by attempting to open it using a dedicated HDF5 viewer or another tool that can handle HDF5 files.
3. **Check File Type**: Make sure the file is indeed an HDF5 file.

### Modifying the Script:
To handle this error gracefully and ensure the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can add error handling in the script using a try-except block. Here's an example of how you might modify the script:

```python
import h5py
import sys
import logging

def main():
    worker_file = "path_to_worker_file"  # Replace with your actual logic
    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Process the file
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open the file {worker_file}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program with a non-zero code

    logging.info("Completed all optimizations successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Try-Except Block**: Wrap the file opening logic in a try-except block to catch `OSError`.
- **Logging**: Log the error with details for debugging.
- **Clean Exit**: Use `sys.exit(1)` to exit the program if the file cannot be opened. This stops the process and returns a non-zero exit code, indicating an error.

### Recovery:
If you have backup files or intermediate results, you might be able to recover or regenerate the missing data. If the error is due to a transient issue, like a temporary file system problem, retrying the operation may succeed.
