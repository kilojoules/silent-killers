The error message you provided indicates that the script encountered an issue while trying to open an HDF5 file using the `h5py` library, and the specific error is "OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)." This typically means that the file is either corrupted, missing, or not an HDF5 file at all.

To detect this issue reliably and stop the process cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement error handling around the file opening operation. Here is a strategy you can follow to modify the script:

1. **Wrap the file opening operation with a try-except block**: This will allow you to catch the `OSError` and handle it gracefully.

2. **Log the error and stop the process**: If an error is encountered, log the issue for debugging purposes and stop the process cleanly.

3. **Consider implementing a validation function**: Before attempting to open the file, you might want to check if the file exists and perform some basic validation to ensure it is an HDF5 file.

Here's an example of how the script can be modified to include these improvements:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import os
import sys

def is_valid_hdf5_file(filepath):
    """Check if a file is a valid HDF5 file."""
    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return False
    try:
        with h5py.File(filepath, 'r') as _:
            return True
    except OSError:
        return False

def main():
    worker_file = 'path_to_worker_file'  # Replace with actual file path

    # Check if the file is valid before opening
    if not is_valid_hdf5_file(worker_file):
        logging.error(f"Invalid or corrupted HDF5 file: {worker_file}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program with a non-zero code indicating an error

    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Process the file as needed
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open HDF5 file {worker_file}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program with a non-zero code indicating an error

    # Continue with the rest of the script
    logging.info("Completed all optimizations successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    main()
```

### Key Points:

- **File Validation**: The `is_valid_hdf5_file` function checks if the file exists and attempts to open it to confirm it is a valid HDF5 file.
- **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block around `h5py.File` captures `OSError` exceptions, logs an error message, and stops the process.
- **Logging**: Use the `logging` module to provide informative error messages, making debugging easier.

This approach will ensure that if any worker file is invalid, the error is detected, logged, and the process stops cleanly, preventing any further operations on invalid data.
