The error message indicates that the script encountered an issue when attempting to open an HDF5 file (`worker_file`) using the `h5py` library. Specifically, the error `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)` suggests that the file is either missing or corrupted, which leads to the failure of the script at that point.

To address this issue and ensure that the process stops cleanly when a worker file is invalid, you can implement error handling around the file opening operation. Here are some steps you can take to modify your script:

1. **Add Error Handling**: Use a `try-except` block to catch the `OSError` when attempting to open a file. This will allow you to handle the error gracefully.

2. **Log the Error**: Use logging to record an error message indicating which file caused the issue. This can help with troubleshooting.

3. **Cleanly Stop the Process**: After logging the error, you can choose to either stop the entire process or skip the problematic file and continue processing others.

Here is an example of how you might modify your script:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import sys

def main():
    worker_files = [...]  # list of worker file paths
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Process the file as needed
                pass
        except OSError as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to open worker file {worker_file}: {e}")
            # Option 1: Stop the entire process
            sys.exit(f"Stopping process due to file error: {worker_file}")
            # Option 2: Skip this file and continue
            # continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    main()
```

### Key Points:

- **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block around the file opening ensures that the script can handle file-related errors without crashing unexpectedly.

- **Logging**: Using `logging.error()` provides detailed information about the failure, which can be critical for debugging.

- **Process Termination**: You have a choice between stopping the entire process (`sys.exit()`) or skipping the problematic file (`continue`) and continuing with the remaining files. Choose based on your requirements.

- **Recovery Strategy**: If you have additional files or backups that could help recover missing data, you could implement a strategy to check for alternate files or notify a user to perform a manual recovery.

Implementing these changes should help in detecting invalid worker files more reliably and ensure that the process stops or recovers cleanly.
