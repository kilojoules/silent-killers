The error message you encountered indicates that there was an attempt to open an HDF5 file using the `h5py` library, but it failed because the file signature was not found. This is often due to the file being missing, corrupted, or not being a valid HDF5 file. To ensure that this type of error is detected reliably and stops the process cleanly, you can implement some error handling around the file opening operation. Here’s a step-by-step approach to modify your script:

1. **Check File Existence:** Before attempting to open a file, verify that the file exists using Python’s built-in `os.path` or the `pathlib` module.

2. **Try-Except Block:** Use a try-except block to catch exceptions when attempting to open the file. Specifically, catch `OSError` to handle cases where the file cannot be opened.

3. **Logging:** Log an error message if an exception is caught, which helps track which file caused the issue.

4. **Graceful Exit:** Decide what the script should do when an error is encountered. If stopping the entire process is necessary, you can exit the program. Alternatively, you can skip the problematic file and continue processing others.

Here is an example of how you might modify your script:

```python
import os
import logging
import h5py
import sys

def main():
    # Assuming worker_files is a list of file paths you want to process
    worker_files = [...]  # Populate this with your list of files
    
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        # Check if the file exists
        if not os.path.exists(worker_file):
            logging.error(f"File not found: {worker_file}")
            continue  # Or break if you want to stop the process
        
        # Try to open the file
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Process the file
                pass
        except OSError as e:
            logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
            # Decide whether to exit or continue
            sys.exit(1)  # Use this to stop the process

    # Continue with the rest of your script
    logging.info("Completed processing all worker files.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    main()
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Backup and Recovery:** If possible, keep backups of important files so you can recover if a file is corrupted.
- **Validation:** Consider adding file validation to ensure files are not only present but also contain expected data before processing.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring and alerting to notify you when a process fails.

By implementing these error handling techniques, you can make your script more robust and ensure it handles issues with worker files gracefully.
