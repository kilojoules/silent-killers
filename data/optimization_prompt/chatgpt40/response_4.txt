The error message you encountered indicates an issue with opening an HDF5 file using the `h5py` library. Specifically, the error `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)` suggests that the script is attempting to open an invalid or corrupted HDF5 file. This could be due to an incorrect file path, a damaged file, or a file that isn't an HDF5 file.

To address this issue and ensure that the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can modify the script to include error handling around the file opening operation. Here's a general approach you can take:

1. **Add Error Handling:** Use a `try-except` block to catch the `OSError` when attempting to open the file.

2. **Log the Error:** Log the error message to understand which file caused the issue.

3. **Terminate the Process:** Cleanly terminate the process if an invalid file is detected.

Here's a modified version of the relevant part of your script:

```python
import logging
import sys

def main():
    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Your processing code here
            pass
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open file {worker_file}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero status to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    main()
```

**Additional Steps:**

- **Verify File Integrity:** Before running the script, verify that all worker files are in the correct format and not corrupted.

- **Backup and Recovery:** If you have partial results saved in other files, consider implementing a checkpoint or recovery mechanism to resume processing from the last successful point.

- **Automated Validity Check:** Before processing, you can add a preliminary step to check the validity of all worker files.

By implementing these changes, your script will be more robust and will terminate gracefully if an invalid file is encountered, providing you with information about which file caused the problem.
