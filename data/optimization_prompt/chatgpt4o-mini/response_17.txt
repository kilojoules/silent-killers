The error message you're encountering indicates that the script is attempting to open a file (in this case, an HDF5 file) that is either corrupted or not an HDF5 file at all. Specifically, the error `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)` suggests that the file format is not recognized or that the file is unreadable due to corruption.

To ensure that this error is detected reliably and the process stops gracefully, you can take the following steps in your script:

1. **File Validation**: Before attempting to open the file with `h5py.File`, you should validate that the file exists and is an HDF5 file. You can do this by checking the file extension and, more reliably, by trying to read the file's signature.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling using try-except blocks to catch exceptions that occur when attempting to open the file.

3. **Logging**: Log errors to keep track of which files failed and why.

4. **Graceful Shutdown**: If an error is detected, ensure that the script cleans up any ongoing processes and exits gracefully.

Hereâ€™s a modified version of the relevant part of your script incorporating these suggestions:

```python
import os
import h5py
import logging

def is_valid_hdf5_file(file_path):
    """Check if the file is a valid HDF5 file."""
    try:
        with h5py.File(file_path, 'r'):
            return True
    except (OSError, IOError):
        return False

def main():
    worker_files = ['file1.h5', 'file2.h5', 'file3.h5']  # List of worker files
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        # Check if the file exists
        if not os.path.exists(worker_file):
            logging.error(f"File {worker_file} does not exist.")
            continue  # Skip to the next file

        # Validate the HDF5 file
        if not is_valid_hdf5_file(worker_file):
            logging.error(f"Invalid HDF5 file: {worker_file}. Skipping this file.")
            continue  # Skip to the next file

        # Proceed to process the valid file
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # perform operations
                pass  # Replace with actual processing logic
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An error occurred while processing {worker_file}: {e}")
            # Optionally: raise or exit to stop processing further
            break  # Stop processing if an error occurs

    logging.info("Processing completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Modifications Explained:
1. **File Existence Check**: Before trying to open a file, the script checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`.
2. **Valid HDF5 Check**: The function `is_valid_hdf5_file` attempts to open the file and catch any exceptions related to file validity.
3. **Error Logging**: Errors are logged using the `logging` module for easier debugging.
4. **Graceful Exit**: You can choose to exit the loop or halt the entire process if a critical error is encountered.

### Additional Suggestions:
- If you have recovered files that may help, consider implementing a recovery strategy where you can attempt to repair or replace missing data files if they are known to be corrupt.
- Regularly back up your worker files to minimize data loss in case of corruption.
