Based on the error message you've provided, it appears that the script encountered an `OSError` because it was unable to open a file in HDF5 format. The specific message "Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)" suggests that the file being accessed is either corrupted, does not exist, or is not actually in HDF5 format.

### Diagnosis
1. **File Corruption or Format**: The file that the script is trying to open might be corrupted or not in the expected HDF5 format. This can happen if a file was not properly written, or if a different type of file is being accessed mistakenly.

2. **Error Handling**: The current implementation of the script does not seem to have robust error handling for file access operations. This means that when it encounters an issue opening a file, it does not stop the processing of other files or provide helpful feedback.

3. **Joining Operation**: If you mentioned that a "joining operation" may have caused the issue, it could indicate that the process of combining results or files is where files are being incorrectly handled or mismatched.

### Proposed Modifications
To ensure that the script detects this error reliably and stops the process cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement the following modifications:

1. **Add Error Handling**:
   Wrap the file access logic in a try-except block. This will allow you to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately.

    ```python
    import h5py
    import logging
    import sys

    def main():
        worker_files = [...]  # List of your worker files

        for worker_file in worker_files:
            try:
                with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                    # Process the file here
                    pass
            except OSError as e:
                logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
                # Optionally, you can raise an exception or exit
                sys.exit(1)  # Stop the process on error
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
                sys.exit(1)  # Stop the process on error
    ```

2. **File Validation**:
   Before attempting to open the file, you could add a validation step to check if the file exists and if the file is likely in the correct format.

    ```python
    import os

    def is_hdf5_file(filepath):
        return os.path.isfile(filepath) and filepath.endswith('.h5')  # Adjust based on your file extension

    for worker_file in worker_files:
        if not is_hdf5_file(worker_file):
            logging.error(f"File {worker_file} is not a valid HDF5 file.")
            sys.exit(1)  # Stop the process on invalid file
        # Proceed with opening the file as before
    ```

3. **Logging**:
   Ensure that all errors are logged clearly, so you can review the cause of any failures after the script runs. Use the logging module for better control over logging levels and outputs.

### Summary
By adding robust error handling, you can ensure that any issues with file access will be caught, logged, and handled gracefully, preventing the script from continuing in an invalid state. This will help maintain the integrity of your optimization process and allow for easier debugging in the future.
