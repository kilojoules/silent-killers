The error message you're encountering indicates that the script is attempting to open an HDF5 file using the `h5py` library, but it is unable to do so because the file signature is not found. This typically means that the file is either corrupted or not in the expected HDF5 format. To ensure that your script can detect this error reliably and stop the process cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement a few strategies:

### Implement Error Handling

1. **Try-Except Blocks**: Wrap the code that opens the HDF5 file in a try-except block to catch any exceptions, specifically the `OSError` that is thrown when the file cannot be opened.

   ```python
   import h5py

   def process_worker_file(worker_file):
       try:
           with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
               # Process the file here
       except OSError as e:
           print(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
           raise  # Re-raise the exception to stop the process
   ```

2. **File Validation Before Opening**: Before attempting to open the file, you can implement a function to check if the file exists and if it has the correct size or extension. However, this might not guarantee that the file is a valid HDF5 file.

   ```python
   import os

   def is_valid_hdf5_file(file_path):
       return os.path.isfile(file_path) and file_path.endswith('.h5')  # Add more checks if needed

   if is_valid_hdf5_file(worker_file):
       process_worker_file(worker_file)
   else:
       print(f"Invalid file: {worker_file}")
       raise ValueError(f"Invalid file: {worker_file}")
   ```

3. **Log Errors**: Make sure to log any errors encountered so that you can review them later. You can use the logging module to log errors instead of using print statements.

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

   def process_worker_file(worker_file):
       try:
           with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
               # Process the file here
       except OSError as e:
           logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
           raise  # Stop the process
   ```

### Graceful Process Termination

1. **Exit on Error**: If you catch an error, make sure to exit the script using `sys.exit()` to terminate the process cleanly.

   ```python
   import sys

   def process_worker_file(worker_file):
       try:
           with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
               # Process the file here
       except OSError as e:
           logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
           sys.exit(1)  # Exit the script with a non-zero status
   ```

### Additional Considerations

- **Check File Integrity**: If you suspect that some files are corrupted, you might consider implementing a file checksum or hash verification to ensure that the files are not only present but also intact.
- **Batch Processing**: If processing a large number of files, consider implementing batch processing where you can skip invalid files but still log them for review.
- **Debugging**: If the joining operation seems to be the cause, you might want to isolate that part of your code and add additional logging to understand how it might be leading to missing or corrupted files.

By applying these strategies, your script should be able to detect and handle errors related to invalid worker files more effectively, leading to a cleaner termination of the process when such issues arise.
