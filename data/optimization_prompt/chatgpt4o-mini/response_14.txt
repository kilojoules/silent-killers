Based on the error log you've provided, it seems that the script is encountering an issue when trying to open a file using the `h5py` library, specifically an OSError indicating that the file signature is not found. This suggests that the file being accessed is either corrupted, missing, or not in the expected HDF5 format.

To ensure that this error is detected reliably and that the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can modify your script with the following steps:

### 1. **File Validation Before Opening:**
   Before attempting to open each file, check if the file exists and is indeed a valid HDF5 file. You can use the `h5py.is_hdf5()` function to check if the file is a valid HDF5 file.

### 2. **Error Handling with Try-Except Block:**
   Wrap the file opening logic in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may arise when trying to open the file. This allows you to handle errors gracefully and log them appropriately.

### 3. **Logging and Exiting:**
   Upon catching an error, log the error message and exit the process cleanly.

### Example Code Modification:
Hereâ€™s a modified version of the relevant part of your script:

```python
import os
import h5py
import sys
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def process_worker_file(worker_file):
    # Check if the file exists
    if not os.path.isfile(worker_file):
        logging.error(f"Worker file not found: {worker_file}")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Check if the file is a valid HDF5 file
    if not h5py.is_hdf5(worker_file):
        logging.error(f"Invalid HDF5 file: {worker_file}")
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Process the file
            pass  # Your file processing logic here
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to open file {worker_file}: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    # Assuming worker_files is a list of files to be processed
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        process_worker_file(worker_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Modifications:
1. **File Existence Check:** The script checks if the file exists before attempting to open it.
2. **HDF5 Validity Check:** The script checks if the file is a valid HDF5 file using `h5py.is_hdf5()`.
3. **Error Handling:** The try-except block captures any `OSError` and logs an appropriate message. The process is then exited cleanly using `sys.exit(1)`, which indicates an error occurred.

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Log All Errors:** Make sure to log all errors to help in diagnosing issues later.
- **Batch Processing:** If you're processing multiple files, you might want to aggregate errors and handle them after all files have been attempted, depending on your specific needs.
- **Recovery Mechanism:** If you have backup files, consider implementing a recovery mechanism that attempts to use these files if the primary ones fail.

By implementing these modifications, you should be able to detect invalid worker files more reliably and handle errors in a cleaner manner.
