The error message indicates that the script is trying to open a file using the `h5py` library, but it cannot find a valid HDF5 file signature in the specified worker file. This usually means that the file is either corrupted, not an HDF5 file, or possibly empty.

To ensure that this error is detected reliably and that the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can take the following steps:

### 1. Validate the Worker Files

Before attempting to open each worker file, add a validation step to check whether the file exists and whether it’s a valid HDF5 file. You can use a try-except block to catch `OSError` exceptions when trying to open the files.

### 2. Modify the Script

Here’s a modified example of how you could implement this in your script:

```python
import os
import h5py

def is_valid_hdf5(file_name):
    """ Check if a file is a valid HDF5 file. """
    try:
        with h5py.File(file_name, 'r'):
            return True
    except (OSError, IOError):
        return False

def main():
    # Assuming you have a list of worker files
    worker_files = ['file1.h5', 'file2.h5', 'file3.h5']  # Replace with your actual file names
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        if not os.path.exists(worker_file):
            print(f"Error: File {worker_file} does not exist.")
            return  # Stop the process

        if not is_valid_hdf5(worker_file):
            print(f"Error: File {worker_file} is not a valid HDF5 file.")
            return  # Stop the process

        # Proceed with processing the valid worker file
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Your processing logic here
            pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 3. Explanation of the Changes

- **Validation Function**: The `is_valid_hdf5` function attempts to open the file and catches any `OSError` or `IOError`. If the file can be opened without exception, it is considered valid.
- **File Existence Check**: Before checking validity, the script checks if the file exists. If it does not, an error message is printed, and the process stops.
- **Early Termination**: If any file is found to be invalid or non-existent, the script terminates early, preventing further processing and potential cascading errors.

### 4. Additional Considerations

- **Logging**: Instead of just printing errors, consider using a logging framework to log messages at different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
- **Error Handling**: Depending on your use case, you may want to implement more sophisticated error handling, such as retrying to open files or skipping invalid files while continuing with valid ones.
- **File Recovery**: If you suspect that some files are corrupted but still contain some recoverable data, you might need to implement a more complex recovery mechanism or use tools designed for HDF5 file recovery.

By implementing these modifications, you can ensure that your script detects file issues reliably and stops processing cleanly if any worker file is invalid.
