The error message you're encountering indicates that the script is attempting to open a file using the HDF5 library (h5py) but is unable to do so, likely because the file is invalid or corrupted. The error "OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)" suggests that the file being accessed does not contain the expected HDF5 file signature.

To ensure that this issue is detected reliably and that the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement the following modifications to your script:

### 1. File Validation Before Processing
Before attempting to open each HDF5 file, you should validate that the file exists and is a valid HDF5 file. You can do this by checking the file signature or attempting to open the file in a try-except block.

### 2. Exception Handling
Wrap the file opening and processing logic in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that occur. If an exception is raised, log the error and terminate the process gracefully.

### 3. Logging
Ensure that you log any errors encountered so that you can diagnose issues later. Use logging instead of print statements for better tracking.

### Example Code Modification
Here is an example of how you might modify your script:

```python
import os
import h5py
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def is_valid_hdf5_file(file_path):
    """Check if the file is a valid HDF5 file."""
    try:
        with h5py.File(file_path, 'r'):
            return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Invalid HDF5 file {file_path}: {e}")
        return False

def process_worker_file(worker_file):
    """Process the worker file."""
    if not is_valid_hdf5_file(worker_file):
        logging.error(f"Stopping process due to invalid file: {worker_file}")
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid HDF5 file: {worker_file}")
    
    # Continue processing if the file is valid
    with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
        # Your processing logic here
        pass

def main():
    worker_files = [...]  # Your list of worker files
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        try:
            process_worker_file(worker_file)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.critical(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            break  # Stop the process on error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Summary
- **File Validation**: The `is_valid_hdf5_file` function checks if a file is a valid HDF5 file.
- **Exception Handling**: The `process_worker_file` function raises an error if the file is invalid, stopping the process.
- **Logging**: Use the logging module to keep track of errors and important information.

By implementing these changes, your script should be able to detect invalid worker files reliably and stop the process cleanly if any issues are encountered.
