The error message you're receiving indicates that the script is attempting to open an HDF5 file, but it cannot find a valid file signature. This typically suggests that the file is either corrupted or not in the expected HDF5 format. The error occurs during a file operation, which can be problematic if the process doesn't handle it gracefully.

To ensure that the script detects this error reliably and stops the process cleanly when any worker file is invalid, you can take the following steps:

1. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks around the file opening operations. This will allow you to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately.

2. **Validation Check**: Before attempting to open a file, you can implement a preliminary check to see if the file exists and if it is a valid HDF5 file. This can be done using the `h5py` library.

3. **Logging**: Add logging statements to record any errors that occur, including the specific file that caused the error.

4. **Graceful Exit**: Ensure that the script exits cleanly after logging the error, rather than allowing it to continue running and potentially causing further issues.

Here's an example of how you might modify the script to incorporate these suggestions:

```python
import h5py
import os
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def open_hdf5_file(worker_file):
    """Open an HDF5 file with error handling."""
    if not os.path.exists(worker_file):
        logging.error(f"File not found: {worker_file}")
        return None

    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Process the file
            # ...
            return h5_in
    except OSError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    worker_files = [...]  # List of worker files to process
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        result = open_hdf5_file(worker_file)
        if result is None:
            logging.error("Aborting process due to file error.")
            return  # Exit the main function if there was an error

        # Continue processing if the file was opened successfully
        # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Error Handling**: The `open_hdf5_file` function attempts to open the HDF5 file and returns `None` if it encounters an error.
- **File Existence Check**: The script checks if the file exists before trying to open it.
- **Logging**: Any errors are logged with the file's name, and the script logs when it aborts due to an error.
- **Graceful Exit**: The script exits the main processing loop if there is an error, preventing further operations that could lead to additional issues.

By implementing these changes, you should be able to detect errors related to invalid worker files more reliably and ensure that the process stops cleanly when such errors occur.
