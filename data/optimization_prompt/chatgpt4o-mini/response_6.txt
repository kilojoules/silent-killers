The error message you are encountering indicates that the script is trying to open a file using the `h5py` library, but it fails with an `OSError` because the file's signature is not found. This typically means that the file is either corrupted, not a valid HDF5 file, or does not exist at the specified path.

### Diagnosing the Issue

1. **File Integrity**: First, ensure that the worker files being referenced in the script are indeed valid HDF5 files. You can do this by trying to open each file separately using `h5py` in a simple test script or interactive Python session.

2. **File Existence**: Verify that the file paths being used in the script are correct and that the files exist at those locations. You can add logging to print the file paths before attempting to open them.

3. **Error Handling**: If the script doesn't currently have error handling for file operations, this could lead to unhandled exceptions when a file is not valid or missing. This needs to be addressed.

### Modifying the Script

To ensure that the error is detected reliably and that the process stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement the following changes in your script:

1. **Add Error Handling**: Wrap the file opening operation in a try-except block to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.

2. **Logging**: Log detailed error messages when a file fails to open, including the file path and reason for the failure.

3. **Graceful Exit**: If an error occurs while opening a file, exit the script cleanly and inform the user.

Here's an example of how you might modify the relevant section of your script:

```python
import h5py
import logging
import sys

def main():
    # Assume worker_files is a list of the paths to your worker files
    worker_files = [...]  # Populate this with your actual worker file paths

    for worker_file in worker_files:
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Perform operations with h5_in
                pass  # Replace with actual processing code
        except OSError as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to open file {worker_file}: {e}")
            # Cleanly exit with a non-zero status code
            sys.exit(1)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred with file {worker_file}: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

    # Continue with the rest of the processing
    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Additional Considerations

- **File Verification**: Before attempting to open the files, you might want to add a verification step that checks if each file exists and if it has the expected file size or format.
  
- **Recovery Mechanism**: If you indeed have backups or alternative files, consider implementing a fallback mechanism to try opening a backup file if the primary one fails.

- **Unit Tests**: If feasible, create unit tests for this part of the code to ensure that it behaves as expected under various scenarios (e.g., valid files, corrupt files, missing files).

By implementing these changes, your script should be able to detect issues with worker files more reliably and handle them gracefully, ensuring that the process does not continue with invalid data.
