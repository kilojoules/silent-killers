The error message you're encountering indicates that the script is attempting to open a file using the `h5py` library, but it is unable to do so because the file appears to be invalid or corrupted (the error "Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)" suggests that the file might not be a valid HDF5 file).

To ensure that the process detects this error reliably and stops cleanly if any worker file is invalid, you can implement the following modifications to your script:

### 1. Error Handling with Try-Except Block
Wrap the file opening code in a try-except block. This will allow you to catch exceptions when attempting to open an invalid file and handle them accordingly.

```python
import h5py
import sys

def main():
    # Your setup and processing code here...
    
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Process the file...
                pass  # Replace with your processing logic
        except OSError as e:
            print(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
            # Optionally log the error to a log file
            # LogError(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit the script with an error code
```

### 2. Validate Files Before Processing
If you have a way to validate the HDF5 files before attempting to open them, such as checking file signatures or ensuring that they exist, consider implementing that validation step.

```python
import os

def is_valid_hdf5(file_path):
    # Check if the file exists and is of the correct size or format
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        return False
    # Further checks can be implemented, e.g., checking file size or performing a quick read
    return True

def main():
    # Your setup code...
    
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        if not is_valid_hdf5(worker_file):
            print(f"Invalid HDF5 file: {worker_file}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if invalid file
        
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Process the file...
                pass
        except OSError as e:
            print(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)
```

### 3. Logging for Debugging
Implement logging to capture detailed error information without cluttering standard output. This can help you diagnose issues with specific files.

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='error_log.txt', level=logging.ERROR)

def main():
    # Your setup code...
    
    for worker_file in worker_files:
        try:
            with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
                # Process the file...
                pass
        except OSError as e:
            logging.error(f"Error opening file {worker_file}: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```

### 4. Clean Exit
If the process is interrupted or an error occurs, ensure that the script exits cleanly without leaving any processes hanging.

### Summary
By implementing these error handling mechanisms, your script will be more robust against invalid files. It will log detailed error information, exit gracefully if an error occurs, and you can also incorporate pre-validation checks for additional reliability. This will help you diagnose issues more effectively and maintain a clean execution flow, especially when processing multiple files.
