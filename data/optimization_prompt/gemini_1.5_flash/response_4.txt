The error message "OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)" indicates that the HDF5 file specified by `worker_file` is corrupted or not a valid HDF5 file.  The script likely failed to properly handle this exception, leading to a crash.  The problem isn't necessarily with the *joining* operation itself, but rather that a corrupted worker file was encountered *during* the joining or processing.

Here's how to modify the script to reliably detect and handle invalid worker files:

```python
import h5py
import os
import multiprocessing as mp
# ... other imports ...

def process_worker_file(worker_file):
    """Processes a single worker file, handling potential errors."""
    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # Your existing code to process the HDF5 file goes here.
            # ... process data from h5_in ...
            return  # or return processed data
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"ERROR: Could not open or process worker file {worker_file}: {e}")
        return None  # Indicate failure
    except Exception as e: # Catch other potential errors during processing
        print(f"ERROR: An error occurred while processing {worker_file}: {e}")
        return None


def main():
    # ... your existing code to generate worker_files ...

    with mp.Pool(processes=mp.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_worker_file, worker_files)

    # Check for errors
    failed_files = [worker_files[i] for i, result in enumerate(results) if result is None]
    if failed_files:
        print(f"ERROR: Processing failed for the following worker files: {failed_files}")
        #  Here you can choose to:
        #  1. Exit the program completely:
        exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code to signal failure

        #  2. Attempt to recover partially (if appropriate):
        #     Process only the successfully completed files.  
        #     This requires careful consideration of how your data is structured
        #     and whether partial results are useful.

        #  3. Log the errors and continue (if partial results are acceptable):
        #     This is risky if the errors indicate data corruption that could
        #     affect the validity of the overall results.


    # ... your existing code to process the results (only if no errors) ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

**Key improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The `process_worker_file` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch `OSError` (and other potential exceptions) specifically related to opening and processing the HDF5 file.  This prevents the entire script from crashing if one file is problematic.
* **Explicit Failure Indication:** The function returns `None` if an error occurs, allowing the main process to identify failed worker files.
* **Centralized Error Reporting:** The `main` function collects and reports all failed files.
* **Clean Exit:** The script exits cleanly with a non-zero exit code if any file processing fails, signaling an error to the calling process or script.  You can adjust the error handling (comments show alternatives).
* **Multiprocessing Robustness:** The use of `multiprocessing.Pool` ensures that errors in one worker don't bring down the others.


**Regarding recovery:**  The possibility of recovering from this depends entirely on how your data is structured and what constitutes an acceptable level of "partial" results.  If the missing data represents a small fraction of the total data and the missing parts are not crucial, you might choose to continue with the successfully processed files, but you'll need to adapt the code to handle the missing data appropriately.  If the missing data is crucial, then recovering is likely not possible without re-running the job with the problematic file(s) fixed.


Before re-running, investigate *why* the HDF5 file is corrupted. Possibilities include:

* **Disk errors:** Check the integrity of your storage.
* **Interrupted write:** Ensure the worker processes are properly terminated (not abruptly killed).
* **HDF5 library issues:**  Update your HDF5 library to the latest version.
* **Bugs in your data writing code:** Review the code that creates the HDF5 files.


By implementing these changes, your script will be more robust and less prone to unexpected crashes due to invalid worker files. Remember to carefully consider the implications of partial results and choose the error handling strategy that best suits your needs.
