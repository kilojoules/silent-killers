The error message "OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)" indicates that the HDF5 file specified by `worker_file` is corrupted or not a valid HDF5 file.  This is happening during the final stage of your process, after 2999 out of 3000 optimizations have completed successfully.  The problem lies in how your script handles potential errors during file processing.

The script's current behavior is to only detect the error *after* attempting to open the problematic file.  This means 2999 successful runs don't prevent the complete failure.

Here's how to modify the script to reliably detect and handle invalid worker files:

**1.  Error Handling within the Loop:**

The most crucial change is to wrap the file opening and processing within a `try-except` block. This will catch the `OSError` (or a more general `IOError`) *before* the script crashes.

```python
import h5py
import os # added for os.path.exists

# ... other code ...

def process_worker_file(worker_file):
    """Processes a single worker file; handles potential errors."""
    if not os.path.exists(worker_file):  # Check if file exists before trying to open
        print(f"Error: Worker file not found: {worker_file}. Skipping.")
        return None  # Or raise an exception if you prefer

    try:
        with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
            # ... your existing code to process the h5_in file ...
            # ... return the processed data ...
            return processed_data # Replace with actual return value
    except (OSError, IOError) as e:
        print(f"Error processing worker file {worker_file}: {e}. Skipping.")
        return None  # Or handle the error appropriately (e.g., log, retry, etc.)


def main():
    # ... your existing code ...

    for i in range(3000): # or however many you need
        worker_file = f"worker_file_{i}.h5" # Replace with your actual file naming scheme
        processed_data = process_worker_file(worker_file)
        if processed_data is None: # Check if processing failed
            continue #Skip to the next iteration

        # ... process the 'processed_data' ...

    # ... rest of your main function ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**2.  Overall Process Monitoring:**

Consider adding a counter to track successful and failed processes:

```python
successful_count = 0
failed_count = 0
for i in range(3000):
    # ... your processing code ...
    if processed_data is not None:
        successful_count += 1
    else:
        failed_count += 1

print(f"Successfully processed {successful_count} files. Failed to process {failed_count} files.")

if failed_count > 0:
    print("Some files failed to process.  Exiting.")
    # Optionally: Raise an exception to explicitly stop the script.
    # raise Exception("File processing errors encountered.")
```

**3.  Robust File Path Handling:**

Ensure that `worker_file` is constructed correctly, including handling potential errors in the file path generation.  Use `os.path.join()` for platform-independent path construction.

**4.  Investigate the Corrupted File:**

The most important step is to find out *why* the HDF5 file is corrupted.  This could be due to:

* **Disk errors:** Check the health of your storage.
* **Interrupted writing:**  If the files are written by a separate process, ensure that process completes writing before your script tries to read them.  Consider adding proper file locking mechanisms if concurrent access is possible.
* **Software bugs:**  There might be a bug in the code that generates or writes these HDF5 files.  Examine that code carefully.
* **Insufficient disk space:**  While less likely, a full disk could lead to unexpected file corruption.

By implementing these changes, your script will be much more robust and less prone to crashing due to invalid worker files. Remember to replace `"worker_file_{i}.h5"` with your actual file naming convention.  The added `os.path.exists` check prevents trying to open non-existent files.  Always handle potential errors gracefully.
