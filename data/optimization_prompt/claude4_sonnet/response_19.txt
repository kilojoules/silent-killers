Looking at this error, I can diagnose the issue:

## Diagnosis

The error `OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)` indicates that one of the worker HDF5 files is corrupted or incomplete. This likely happened because:

1. A worker process was interrupted/killed while writing to an HDF5 file
2. The file exists but has an invalid HDF5 signature/header
3. The multiprocessing completion tracking (2999/3000) suggests one optimization failed but the script didn't detect it properly

## Solution

Here's how to modify the script to detect and handle corrupted files reliably:

```python
import h5py
import os
import logging

    """
    Validate that a worker HDF5 file is readable and contains expected data.

            return False, f"File does not exist: {worker_file}"
        
        file_size = os.path.getsize(worker_file)
        if file_size == 0:
            return False, f"File is empty: {worker_file}"

## Recovery Options

For your current situation, you can:

1. **Identify the corrupted file**:
```bash
# Check which worker file is corrupted
for file in worker_*.h5; do
    echo "Checking $file..."
    python -c "import h5py; h5py.File('$file', 'r')" 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "CORRUPTED"
done
```

2. **Manual recovery**:
```python
# Script to merge only valid files
def recover_partial_results():
    temp_dir = "your_temp_directory"
    valid_files, invalid_files, _ = find_and_validate_worker_files(temp_dir)
    
    print(f"Found {len(valid_files)} valid files, {len(invalid_files)} invalid files")
    
    if len(valid_files) >= 47:  # 94% of 50 seeds
        safe_merge_worker_files("recovered_output.h5", temp_dir)
        print("Recovery successful!")
    else:
        print("Too few valid files for meaningful recovery")
```

This approach will prevent similar issues in the future by validating files before attempting to merge them and providing clear error reporting when files are corrupted.
