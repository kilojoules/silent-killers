Certainly! Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to propagate realistic measurement uncertainties through the PyWake framework, calculate the Sobol sensitivity of the effective wind speed (WS_eff), and save flow field images at different time steps. This script assumes you have a basic understanding of Python and that you have PyWake installed along with the necessary libraries.

Please ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pywake sobol_seq matplotlib numpy
```

Here's a sample script:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pywake import WindFarm
from pywake.utils import SobolSensitivity
from pywake.examples import wind_farm
from sobol_seq import i4_sobol
import os

# Set the random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Define measurement uncertainties for wind speed and direction
uncertainty_ws = 0.5  # Example: ±0.5 m/s
uncertainty_wd = 5.0  # Example: ±5 degrees

# Define the number of samples for Sobol analysis
n_samples = 1000

# Wind farm configuration
wind_farm = wind_farm()

# Create output directory for images
output_dir = "flow_field_images"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Generate Sobol samples for wind speed and direction
sobol_samples = np.array(i4_sobol(n_samples, 2))  # 2 dimensions: wind speed and direction
ws_samples = 7 + uncertainty_ws * (sobol_samples[:, 0] * 2 - 1)  # Adjusting based on uncertainty
wd_samples = 180 + uncertainty_wd * (sobol_samples[:, 1] * 2 - 1)  # Adjusting based on uncertainty

# Initialize an array to hold WS_eff values
ws_eff_array = []

# Calculate the flow field and effective wind speed for each sample
for i in range(n_samples):
    # Set wind speed and direction
    wind_farm.set_wind_speed(ws_samples[i])
    wind_farm.set_wind_direction(wd_samples[i])

    # Calculate the flow field
    flow_field = wind_farm.get_flow_field()
    ws_eff = flow_field.WS_eff

    # Store the effective wind speed
    ws_eff_array.append(ws_eff)

# Convert to a NumPy array for analysis
ws_eff_array = np.array(ws_eff_array)

# Calculate Sobol sensitivity
sensitivity = SobolSensitivity(ws_eff_array, n_samples)

# Plot and save the flow field images at different times
x = np.linspace(0, 1000, 100)  # x-coordinates in meters
y = np.linspace(0, 1000, 100)  # y-coordinates in meters
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

for t in range(10):  # Assuming we want to visualize at 10 different time steps
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.contourf(X, Y, ws_eff_array[t].reshape(X.shape), levels=50, cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(label='WS_eff (m/s)')
    plt.title(f'Flow Field at Time Step {t + 1}')
    plt.xlabel('X Position (m)')
    plt.ylabel('Y Position (m)')
    plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_dir, f'flow_field_t{t + 1}.png'))
    plt.close()

print(f"Flow field images saved to {output_dir}")
```

### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Measurement Uncertainties**: You define the uncertainties for wind speed and direction.
2. **Sobol Sampling**: The script generates Sobol samples for the input parameters (wind speed and direction) considering their uncertainties.
3. **Flow Field Calculation**: It calculates the effective wind speed (`WS_eff`) for each sample.
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: The Sobol sensitivity is calculated to understand how sensitive the effective wind speed is to the uncertainties in wind input.
5. **Visualization**: Finally, it visualizes the flow field at different time steps and saves the images to a specified directory.

### Note:
- Ensure you modify the wind farm setup and parameters according to your specific application and data.
- The script assumes a simplified model for visualization; in practice, you may need to handle the flow field data more thoroughly.
- Adjust the number of time steps and the parameters as needed for your analysis.
