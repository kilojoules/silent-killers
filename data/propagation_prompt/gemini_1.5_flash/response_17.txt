This script requires the PyWake library and its dependencies, including numpy, matplotlib, and potentially others depending on your chosen inflow model and plotting preferences.  Make sure you have these installed (`pip install pywake`).  This example uses a simple Gaussian inflow and Sobol sensitivity analysis.  Adapt as needed for your specific inflow and PyWake setup.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pywake.wind_farm_models.wind_farm_model import WindFarmModel
from pywake.turbulence_models.turbulence_model import TurbulenceModel
from pywake.flow_map import XY
from pywake.examples.data.hornsrev1 import Hornsrev1Site
from pywake.wind_farm_models.noj import NOJ
from pywake.utils.sensitivity import SobolSensitivity

# --- Input Parameters ---
n_wt = 10  # Number of wind turbines (adjust as needed)
x_coords = np.linspace(0, 1000, n_wt) # Example x-coordinates (adjust)
y_coords = np.zeros(n_wt) # Example y-coordinates (adjust)
WS_inflow = 8  # Nominal inflow wind speed
WS_unc = 0.5  # Uncertainty in inflow wind speed
n_samples = 100  # Number of Sobol samples

# --- PyWake Setup ---
site = Hornsrev1Site()  # Or your own site object
windTurbines = site.windTurbines  # Or your wind turbine definition

# Simple Gaussian inflow model (replace with your desired model)
def gaussian_inflow(x, y, WS, WS_unc):
    return WS + WS_unc * np.random.normal(0, 1, size=len(x))

# --- Sobol Sensitivity Analysis ---

def ws_eff_func(WS_inflow_sample):
    # Create a WindFarmModel with the perturbed inflow
    flow_map = NOJ(site, windTurbines).calculate_flow_map(
        x_coords, y_coords, WS_inflow=WS_inflow_sample
    )
    # Extract effective wind speed at turbine locations (Example, adjust as needed)
    return flow_map.WS_eff[:, 0]  # Assuming WS_eff is a column in a dataframe


sobol_analysis = SobolSensitivity(
    ws_eff_func,
    parameters=[
        {"name": "WS_inflow", "dist": "uniform", "low": WS_inflow - WS_unc, "high": WS_inflow + WS_unc}
    ],
    n_samples=n_samples,
    calc_second_order=False,
)
sobol_analysis.run()
sobol_analysis.plot()
plt.show()

# --- Flow Field Visualization (Example for a single sample) ---

WS_inflow_sample = WS_inflow + WS_unc * np.random.normal(0,1)
flow_map = NOJ(site, windTurbines).calculate_flow_map(
        x_coords, y_coords, WS_inflow=WS_inflow_sample,
        resolution=20, #Resolution of the map
        x_resolution=10,
        y_resolution=10
    )


# Create a grid for plotting
x_grid = np.linspace(x_coords.min(), x_coords.max(), 100)
y_grid = np.linspace(y_coords.min(), y_coords.max(), 100)
x_grid, y_grid = np.meshgrid(x_grid, y_grid)


#Plot the flow map
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(flow_map.WS_eff, extent=[x_coords.min(), x_coords.max(), y_coords.min(), y_coords.max()], origin='lower')
plt.colorbar(label='Effective Wind Speed (m/s)')
plt.title('Flow Field with Perturbed Inflow')
plt.xlabel('x (m)')
plt.ylabel('y (m)')
plt.show()


# --- Saving Flow Field Images (Example) ---

#For multiple samples, you would loop through different WS_inflow_samples and save the images
#This part is left to be implemented by the user depending on their specific needs


```

Remember to replace placeholder values (like coordinates, turbine types, inflow model) with your actual data.  This script provides a basic framework; you might need to adjust it based on the specifics of your PyWake setup and desired visualizations.  The image saving part is intentionally left as a placeholder, as the best approach depends on your preferred format (e.g., PNG, GIF) and how you want to manage the image files.  Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()` within a loop to save images for each sample.  You may also need to adapt the code to handle the output format of your chosen inflow model and flow map calculation.
