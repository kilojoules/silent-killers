This script requires several libraries. Make sure you have them installed:

```bash
pip install pywake==3.0.1 matplotlib numpy openpyxl sobol_seq
```

The script below uses the Sobol sequence for sensitivity analysis,  which is more efficient for higher dimensions than other methods like Latin Hypercube Sampling.  It's crucial to adapt the `windTurbines` and `flowField` sections to your specific PyWake setup and desired flow field visualization.


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pywake.wind_farm_models import All2AllIterative
from pywake.examples.data.hornsrev1 import Hornsrev1Site, Hornsrev1WindTurbines
from pywake.flow_map import FlowMap
from pywake.utils.plotting import plt_windrose
from pywake.turbulence_models.stf import STF2017
from sobol_seq import i4_sobol_generate

# --- Input Parameters ---
n_samples = 100 # Number of Sobol samples for sensitivity analysis
x_range = (0, 1000) # Range of x coordinates for flow field (adjust as needed)
y_range = (0, 1000) # Range of y coordinates for flow field (adjust as needed)
times = [0, 5, 10] # Time instances for flow field visualization (adjust as needed)


# --- PyWake Setup ---
site = Hornsrev1Site()
windTurbines = Hornsrev1WindTurbines() # Replace with your wind turbine definition
wf_model = All2AllIterative(site, windTurbines, turbulenceModel=STF2017())


# --- Sobol Sequence for Inflow Uncertainty ---
#  Assuming inflow uncertainty in wind speed only (adapt as needed for other parameters)
dim = 1  # Dimension of uncertainty (here, just wind speed)
samples = i4_sobol_generate(dim, n_samples)

# Define the range of uncertainty in wind speed.  This is crucial and should reflect
# your understanding of the uncertainty in the inflow wind speed.
wind_speed_uncertainty = 2  # e.g., +/- 2 m/s around a mean wind speed
mean_wind_speed = 8  # Example mean wind speed


# --- Function to calculate and visualize flow fields ---
def visualize_flow_field(time_index, samples_index):
    wind_speed = mean_wind_speed + (samples[samples_index, 0] - 0.5) * 2 * wind_speed_uncertainty
    
    # Simulate the wind farm
    results = wf_model(windSpeeds=[wind_speed], wd=270, time=time_index) # Adjust wd as needed

    # Create a flow map
    fm = FlowMap(results, resolution=(100,100), x_range=x_range, y_range=y_range)  # Adjust resolution as needed

    # Extract flow field data (replace 'WS_eff' with the variable you want to visualize)
    WS_eff = fm.flow_map('WS_eff')

    # Plot the flow field
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    plt.imshow(WS_eff, extent=[x_range[0], x_range[1], y_range[0], y_range[1]], origin='lower', cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(label='WS_eff (m/s)')
    plt.title(f'Flow Field at Time {time_index} - Sample {samples_index+1} - Wind Speed {wind_speed:.2f} m/s')
    plt.xlabel('x (m)')
    plt.ylabel('y (m)')
    plt.savefig(f'flow_field_time_{time_index}_sample_{samples_index+1}.png')
    plt.close()  # Close the plot to prevent memory issues


# --- Main Loop ---
for time_index in times:
    for samples_index in range(n_samples):
        visualize_flow_field(time_index, samples_index)

print("Flow field images saved.")


# --- Sobol Sensitivity Analysis (Optional) ---
# This section requires further development based on how you define your sensitivity indices.
# Example using a simple approach (replace with more sophisticated method if needed)

#  This is a placeholder; you'll need to adapt this based on your sensitivity analysis needs
#  and how you extract the relevant data from the flow field.  You might use something
#  like a variance-based method.

# WS_eff_data = [] # collect WS_eff data for all samples and times
# for time_index in times:
#     for samples_index in range(n_samples):
#         # extract relevant data from visualize_flow_field - this part needs to be added.
#         # ... your code to extract WS_eff data ...
#         # WS_eff_data.append(...)


# #Perform Sobol analysis - needs a dedicated sensitivity analysis library
# #...


```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your specific code for data extraction and sensitivity analysis.  This enhanced script provides a more complete framework for propagating uncertainties and visualizing the results.  The Sobol sensitivity analysis portion is a starting point; you'll likely need to adapt it based on the specific sensitivity indices you want to calculate and the tools you choose to use.  Consider libraries like `SALib` for more advanced sensitivity analysis.
