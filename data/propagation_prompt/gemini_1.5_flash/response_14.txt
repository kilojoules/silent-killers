This script requires several libraries. Make sure you have them installed:

```bash
pip install pywake==3.0.0  # or latest version
pip install numpy matplotlib openpyxl SALib
```

The script below uses PyWake to simulate a wind farm, propagates uncertainties using the Sobol method from SALib, and visualizes the flow field sensitivity.  Because generating images for the entire flow field at multiple timesteps can be computationally intensive and produce a very large number of files, the example focuses on a single timestep and a smaller subset of the flow field for demonstration.  You can adapt it to your specific needs by adjusting parameters.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pywake.examples.data.hornsrev1 import Hornsrev1Site
from pywake.flow_map import FlowMap
from pywake.wind_farm_models.engineering_models import All2AllIterative
from pywake.turbulence_models.stf import STF2017TurbulenceModel
from SALib.analyze import sobol
from SALib.sample import saltelli
from pywake.utils.plotting import plt_show

# --- Define Wind Farm and Simulation Parameters ---
site = Hornsrev1Site()
x, y = site.initial_position[:, 0], site.initial_position[:, 1]
windTurbines = site.windTurbines
model = All2AllIterative(site, windTurbines, turbulenceModel=STF2017TurbulenceModel())


# --- Uncertainty Analysis Setup ---
problem = {
    'num_vars': 2,
    'names': ['x', 'y'],  # Uncertain parameters
    'bounds': [[-10, 10], [-10, 10]]  # Ranges of uncertainty for x and y (adjust as needed)
}

# Generate Sobol samples
param_values = saltelli.sample(problem, 100) #Adjust sample size as needed (more samples = higher accuracy, but slower)

# --- Run Simulations with Uncertain Inflow ---
WS_eff_all = []
for i, params in enumerate(param_values):
    # Apply uncertainty to initial positions (example: shifting the turbines)
    x_perturbed = x + params[0]
    y_perturbed = y + params[1]
    new_position = np.column_stack((x_perturbed, y_perturbed))
    
    #Re-run the simulation with the perturbed positions
    fm = model.flow_map(new_position, wd=270, ws=10, time=0) #wd, ws, time are parameters you can change 
    WS_eff = fm.WS_eff
    WS_eff_all.append(WS_eff)

WS_eff_all = np.array(WS_eff_all)


# --- Sobol Sensitivity Analysis ---
# Perform Sobol analysis on WS_eff for each turbine
Si = np.zeros((len(x),2))
ST = np.zeros((len(x),2))

for i in range(len(x)):
    Y = WS_eff_all[:,i] #WS_eff for each turbine
    analysis = sobol.analyze(problem, Y, print_to_console=False)
    Si[i,:] = analysis['S1']
    ST[i,:] = analysis['ST']


# --- Visualization (Example for one timestep, limited area)---
#Plot the sensitivity indices
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(Si,extent=(0,1,0,len(x)),aspect='auto')
plt.colorbar(label='First order sensitivity index')
plt.xlabel('Parameter')
plt.ylabel('Turbine Index')
plt.title('First Order Sobol Indices')

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.imshow(ST,extent=(0,1,0,len(x)),aspect='auto')
plt.colorbar(label='Total order sensitivity index')
plt.xlabel('Parameter')
plt.ylabel('Turbine Index')
plt.title('Total Order Sobol Indices')

plt_show()


# --- Save Results (Example: saving sensitivity indices) ---
# You would typically save more extensive data, but this illustrates the basic concept
np.savetxt("first_order_indices.csv", Si, delimiter=",")
np.savetxt("total_order_indices.csv", ST, delimiter=",")


#Note:  To generate images of the entire flow field, you would need to adapt the plotting section to create and save images for each simulation run (each perturbed position).  This can be computationally very expensive.  Consider using a subset of the flow field or downsampling for visualization to make it more manageable.
```

Remember to replace placeholders like the number of samples, uncertainty bounds, and visualization parameters with values appropriate for your specific wind farm and analysis goals.  The script provides a foundation; you'll likely need to expand upon it for a complete and highly detailed analysis.  Consider using more sophisticated visualization techniques and potentially parallelization for improved performance.
