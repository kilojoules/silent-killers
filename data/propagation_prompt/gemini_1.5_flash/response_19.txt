This script uses PyWake, NumPy, and Matplotlib to propagate uncertainties through a wind farm simulation and visualize the sensitivity of the flow field.  It focuses on the Sobol sensitivity analysis of the effective wind speed (`WS_eff`) as a function of x and y coordinates.  Because generating images for a full Sobol analysis can be computationally expensive, it's crucial to use a smaller, representative wind farm for testing and visualization.  For larger farms, consider reducing the image resolution or focusing on a smaller subset of the farm.

# --- Configuration ---
# Reduce Hornsrev1 for faster computation. Adjust as needed.
n_wt = 10  # Number of turbines
site = Hornsrev1Site()
x, y = site.initial_position[:n_wt, :].T


# --- Uncertainty Model ---
# Define the uncertainty in the inflow wind speed.  This is a simplified example.
# For more realistic scenarios, consider using a more sophisticated statistical model
# based on your specific inflow data.

    ws_std = 0.1 * ws_mean
    return np.random.normal(loc=ws_mean, scale=ws_std, size=x.shape)


# --- PyWake Setup ---

# for computational cost vs. accuracy trade-off.
n_samples = 100
sobol_sensitivity = SobolSensitivity(wind_farm_model, ['WS_ilk'], n_samples=n_samples)

# Run the Sobol analysis.  This is the most computationally expensive part.
sobol_results = sobol_sensitivity.analyse(
    x, y, wd=site.wd[0, 0], ws=site.WS_ilk[0, 0]
)


# --- Flow Field Visualization ---
# Select a few time steps to visualize (adjust as needed).

# Create a grid for visualization

**Before running:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:**  `pip install pywake numpy matplotlib`
2. **Adjust parameters:** Modify `n_wt` (number of turbines), `n_samples` (Sobol samples), and `time_steps` to control computational cost and visualization detail.  A smaller wind farm is crucial for reasonable runtimes while demonstrating the concept.
3. **Understand the uncertainty model:**  The `uncertain_inflow` function is a placeholder. Replace it with your specific uncertainty model, potentially incorporating data from meteorological measurements and statistical distributions.

This improved script provides a more complete and practical example of uncertainty propagation and visualization within PyWake. Remember to adapt it to your specific wind farm data and uncertainty characteristics.  The Sobol indices will quantify the sensitivity of the effective wind speed to the input uncertainties, providing valuable insights for wind farm design and optimization.
