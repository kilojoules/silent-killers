This script requires the `pywake`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `SALib` libraries.  Make sure you have them installed (`pip install pywake matplotlib numpy SALib`).  This example uses a simple Gaussian wind field for demonstration; you'll need to adapt it to your specific inflow data and PyWake setup.  The Sobol sensitivity analysis is computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution flow fields. Consider reducing the resolution or the number of Sobol samples for faster execution.

}

# --- Number of Sobol samples (increase for better accuracy, but slower computation) ---

        WS_eff = gaussian_wind_field(X + x_shift, Y + y_shift, t)
        flow_fields.append(WS_eff)


    # Reshape for Sobol analysis (samples x x x y)
    flow_fields = np.array(flow_fields).reshape(len(param_values), -1)

    # --- Sobol Sensitivity Analysis ---
    Si = sobol.analyze(problem, flow_fields, print_to_console=True)

    # --- Plotting ---
    ax = axes[i]
    #Plot Mean flow field
    mean_flow = np.mean(flow_fields, axis=0).reshape(len(x),len(y))
    im = ax.imshow(mean_flow, origin='lower', extent=[0, 1000, 0, 1000], cmap='viridis')
    ax.set_title(f'Time {t}: Sobol Sensitivity - Mean WS_eff')
    ax.set_xlabel('x')
    ax.set_ylabel('y')
    fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax, label='WS_eff')
    # Add sensitivity indices to the plot (optional, can be complex to visualize nicely)
    # You might want to overlay contours or annotations showing the sensitivity

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Remember to replace the placeholder Gaussian wind field with your actual inflow data and adjust the PyWake setup (site, wind turbines, etc.) to match your specific case.  The Sobol analysis will take time; monitor its progress. The output shows the mean flow field and you can add visualizations of the Sobol sensitivity indices (e.g., using contour plots or annotations) to show how the uncertainty in 'x' and 'y' affects the flow field.  Consider using a smaller sample size or lower resolution to reduce computation time during development and testing.
