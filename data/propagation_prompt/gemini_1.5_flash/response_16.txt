This script uses PyWake, a Python library for wind farm simulations, to propagate uncertainties in inflow wind speed through a simulation and visualize the sensitivity of the resulting flow field.  It focuses on Sobol sensitivity analysis of the effective wind speed (`WS_eff`) as a function of x and y coordinates.  Because generating images requires significant computational resources and depends on your specific PyWake setup and desired visualization library (e.g., Matplotlib), this script provides a framework.  You will need to adapt and extend parts based on your data and preferences.

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))

**To make this code runnable, you need to:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:** `pip install pywake SALib matplotlib`
2. **Replace placeholder data:**  Update `x_coords`, `y_coords`, `problem` (uncertainty ranges), and the wind resource data input to reflect your specific wind farm layout, turbine characteristics, and inflow conditions.  Critically, you must adapt the way the uncertainty ( `ws_mean`, `ws_std`) is incorporated into the `wf_model` call.  This will likely involve modifying or extending the wind resource definition within PyWake to account for the sampled uncertainty.
3. **Adapt visualization:** The visualization section uses Matplotlib.  If you prefer a different library (e.g., Seaborn, Plotly), modify this part accordingly.  Consider using a more sophisticated visualization technique to properly represent the uncertainty in the flow field, such as error bars or shaded regions.


Remember that running Sobol sensitivity analysis with a large number of samples can be computationally expensive.  Start with a smaller `n_samples` to test the code and then increase it for better accuracy as needed.  The visualization part will also generate multiple image files.  Consider adjusting the resolution and number of time steps to manage storage requirements.
