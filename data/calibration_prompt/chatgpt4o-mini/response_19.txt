Your code appears to be implementing a wind farm model using the PyWake library, focusing on optimizing wake deficit modeling parameters through Bayesian optimization. You’ve also mentioned that you want to modify the flow field plots and report average and P90 errors.

Here are my thoughts on your approach and some suggestions for rewriting the code to improve modularity and maintainability:

### General Feedback
1. **Modularity**: The code could benefit from being organized into functions or classes. This would make it easier to read, test, and modify. For example, you could create separate functions for data loading, model instantiation, optimization, and evaluation.

2. **Parameter Handling**: Instead of using a mix of dictionaries and individual variables for parameters, consider using a structured approach, such as a configuration class or data class, to encapsulate the parameters used in the simulation. 

3. **Error Handling**: It’s good that you have checks for model numbers, but you could extend error handling to other parts of the code (e.g., when loading data or running the simulations) to make it more robust.

4. **Docstrings and Comments**: Adding docstrings to your functions and more comments throughout the code can help explain what each part does, especially for complex logic.

5. **Visualization Improvements**: Since you mentioned wanting to change how flow field plots are generated, you might want to create a separate function dedicated to plotting. This would allow you to easily customize the visualization without altering the main logic of the script.

6. **Performance Optimization**: If you frequently run simulations that are computationally intensive, consider profiling the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.

### Suggested Refactor
Here's a high-level outline of how you might restructure your code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import xarray as xr
from py_wake import HorizontalGrid
from py_wake.wind_farm_models import All2AllIterative
from bayes_opt import BayesianOptimization
from py_wake.examples.data.dtu10mw._dtu10mw import DTU10MW
from py_wake.examples.data.hornsrev1 import Hornsrev1Site

# Define a class for the Wind Farm Model
class WindFarmModel:
    def __init__(self, model_type, downwind, turbine, site):
        self.model_type = model_type
        self.downwind = downwind
        self.turbine = turbine
        self.site = site
        self.defaults = self.set_defaults()
        self.bounds = self.set_bounds()

    def set_defaults(self):
        # Return a dictionary of default parameters based on model type
        pass # Implement based on your existing defaults

    def set_bounds(self):
        # Return a dictionary of parameter bounds based on model type
        pass # Implement based on your existing pbounds

    def evaluate_rmse(self, **kwargs):
        # Modularize the RMSE evaluation logic here
        pass

    def optimize_parameters(self):
        optimizer = BayesianOptimization(f=self.evaluate_rmse, pbounds=self.bounds)
        optimizer.probe(params=self.defaults, lazy=True)
        optimizer.maximize(init_points=50, n_iter=200)
        return optimizer.max

    def plot_results(self, optimizer):
        # Implement your plotting logic here
        pass

def load_data(filepath):
    return xr.load_dataset(filepath)

def main():
    # Load data
    dat = load_data('./DTU10MW.nc')
    turbine = DTU10MW()
    site = Hornsrev1Site()

    # Initialize the model
    wfm = WindFarmModel(model_type=2, downwind=True, turbine=turbine, site=site)

    # Optimize parameters
    best_params = wfm.optimize_parameters()

    # Plot the results
    wfm.plot_results(best_params)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Changes Implemented:
1. **WindFarmModel Class**: Encapsulates all functionality related to the wind farm model, including parameter optimization and evaluation.

2. **Modular Functions**: Functions like `load_data`, `evaluate_rmse`, and `plot_results` separate concerns and make the code cleaner.

3. **Main Function**: A `main()` function that orchestrates the flow of the program.

### Next Steps:
- Implement the remaining methods in the `WindFarmModel` class based on your existing logic.
- Refactor the plotting and evaluation logic into the respective methods.
- Ensure that all deficit settings and relevant logic are maintained throughout the refactor.

This structure should make your codebase more maintainable and allow for easier modifications in the future.
