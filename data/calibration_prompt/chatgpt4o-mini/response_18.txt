Your code appears to be designed for simulating and optimizing wind farm performance using wake models. The implementation seems comprehensive, and you incorporate several advanced techniques, including Bayesian optimization for tuning parameters of the wake deficit models.

### Feedback on Your Approach:

1. **Modularization**: 
   - Your desire to modularize the code is a good one. Creating functions for specific tasks (e.g., simulation setup, RMSE evaluation, plotting) can improve readability and maintainability.
   - Consider creating a dedicated function for initializing the wind farm model (WFM) with all the necessary parameters. This would encapsulate complexity and allow for easier updates.

2. **Error Reporting**:
   - You mentioned wanting to report averages and p90s of the errors. This is a great idea, as it provides a more complete understanding of model performance. You can compute these metrics after the RMSE calculations and display them in your output.
   - For the RMSE calculation, you might want to store not just the raw RMSE values but also the statistics (mean, p90) in a structured way (like a Pandas DataFrame).

3. **Flow Field Plots**:
   - If you are changing the flow field plots, ensure that the new visualizations effectively communicate the performance of the model. Incorporating overlayed contour plots or difference plots can help highlight discrepancies between observed and predicted values.

4. **Use of Constants**:
   - Constants like `X_LB`, `X_UB`, and model parameters should be defined at the beginning or in a configuration section to make it easier to adjust them without diving into the code.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Adding docstrings to your functions and comments throughout the code will help others (and future you) understand the logic and flow of your implementation.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that you handle potential errors gracefully, especially in the Bayesian optimization section where parameter bounds are defined. Consider using exception handling for cases where the optimization may not converge.

### Suggested Code Rewrite:
Hereâ€™s how you might structure your code to improve modularity while retaining all the logic for deficit settings and model selection.

### Conclusion:
These changes should help create a more organized codebase. Make sure to test the functionality as you refactor to ensure that everything still works as expected. Good luck with your project!
