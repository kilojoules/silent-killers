Your code does a lot of things, and it seems to be fairly complex, which is typical in wind farm modeling. Here are some thoughts on your approach and suggestions for improvement:

### Current Approach
1. **Data Handling**: You're using xarray for handling multi-dimensional datasets, which is appropriate for this kind of work. You've loaded the dataset and manipulated it well.

2. **Modeling**: The use of different models (such as `BlondelSuperGaussianDeficit2020` and `TurboGaussianDeficit`) based on the conditions (like `MODEL` and `DOWNWIND`) is logical and modular. The distinction between two models based on conditions is a good approach.

3. **Optimization**: You're using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, which is a solid choice. The optimizer's setup seems well-structured.

4. **Visualization**: The use of matplotlib for visualizing the optimization process and results is good. The animation of the optimization convergence is a nice touch.

5. **Error Calculation**: The RMSE calculation is straightforward. However, you mentioned wanting to report average and P90 errors, which could provide additional insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Modularization**: 
   - You mentioned wanting to modularize the instantiation of the wind farm model (WFM). This is a great idea. Consider creating a function that encapsulates the logic for instantiating the WFM. This can make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

   Example:
   ```python
   def create_wfm(site, turbine, model, deficit_args, turbulence_args, blockage_args):
       return All2AllIterative(site, turbine,
                               wake_deficitModel=model,
                               superpositionModel=LinearSum(),
                               deflectionModel=None,
                               turbulenceModel=CrespoHernandez(**turbulence_args),
                               blockage_deficitModel=SelfSimilarityDeficit2020(**blockage_args))
   ```

2. **Error Reporting**: 
   - For the flow field plots, consider creating a function that calculates and returns the average and P90 errors, so you can easily call it wherever needed.

   Example:
   ```python
   def calculate_error_metrics(observed, predicted):
       errors = observed - predicted
       avg_error = np.mean(errors)
       p90_error = np.percentile(errors, 90)
       return avg_error, p90_error
   ```

3. **Flow Field Plots**: 
   - If you're planning to change how you visualize the flow fields, consider creating a dedicated function for generating plots. This will allow you to customize plots without repeating code.

   Example:
   ```python
   def plot_flow_field(target_x, target_y, observed_deficit, predicted, diff, t):
       fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(5, 15))
       co = ax[0].contourf(target_x, target_y, observed_deficit.T)
       cp = ax[1].contourf(target_x, target_y, predicted)
       cd = ax[2].contourf(target_x, target_y, diff)
       for jj, c in enumerate([co, cp, cd]):
           fig.colorbar(c, ax=ax[jj])
       ax[0].set_ylabel('Observed')
       ax[1].set_ylabel('Prediction')
       ax[2].set_ylabel('Diff')
       plt.tight_layout()
       plt.savefig(f'figs/downsream_err_{t}')
       plt.clf()
   ```

4. **Readability and Documentation**: 
   - Adding comments and docstrings to your functions will improve readability and maintainability. This is especially helpful for others (and future you) to understand the purpose of each part of your code.

5. **Error Handling**: 
   - You have some error checks (e.g., checking `MODEL`), but consider implementing more robust error handling throughout your code. This can include checks on input data and model parameters.

6. **Parameter Configuration**: 
   - If you find yourself repeating initialization of parameters (like `pbounds` and `defaults`), consider using a configuration dictionary or a class to encapsulate these settings. This can streamline parameter management.

### Conclusion
Overall, your approach is solid, and the suggestions above focus on improving modularity, readability, and error reporting. These changes should make your code cleaner and easier to maintain, which is essential when working on complex modeling tasks.
